= entitygen

This is an attempt to re-create some of the functionality of seam-gen;
it generates the five artifacts needed for a single-entity JSF list-detail application:

. ${Entity}Home.java
. ${Entity}List.java
. ${Entity}List.xhtml
. ${Entity}View.xhtml # the Detail page
. ${Entity}Edit.xhtml

Pre-requisites:
	Apache Maven for building.

APIs used:
.	darwinsys-ee API for EntityHome
	Another repo of mine; not in Central yet; clone it and do "mvn install" to install in your .m2/repository
.	Apache DeltaSpike Data for EntityList.

Limitations:

- only does one entity at a time
- assumes you have already coded the Java Entity and it's on your classpath
- assumes you did so using Field annotations instead of Accessor annotations
- assumes a single level of inheritance for entities
- assumes you want to use PrimeFaces UI.
- assumes you don't mind having the output stuck in ../entitygenoutput/
- Does not yet handle any relationships
- Does not yet handle Enums
- Whatever else I didn't think of yet.

Code generation is done using Apache Velocity; you can edit the templates.

Some of these limitations will be easier or harder to remove than others. UTSL.
Pull Requests welcome.
